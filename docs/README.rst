Introduction
------------

.. introduction-start

ROBERT is an ensemble of automated machine learning protocols that can be run sequentially 
through a single command line or a graphical user interface. The program works for **regression 
and classification problems**. Comprehensive workflows have been designed to meet state-of-the-art 
standards for cheminformatics studies, including:

   *  **Atomic and molecular descriptor generation from SMILES**, including an RDKit conformer sampling and 
      the generation of 200+ steric, electronic and structural descriptors using RDKit, xTB and ᴍᴏʀғᴇᴜs. 
      Requires the `AQME program <https://aqme.readthedocs.io>`__.  
   *  **Data curation**, including filters for correlated descriptors, noise, and duplicates, 
      as well as conversion of categorical descriptors.  
   *  **Model selection**, including the comparison of multiple hyperoptimized models using 
      multiple cross-validation techniques. This approach mitigates overfitting in low-data regimes.
   *  **Prediction** of external test sets, as well as SHAP and PFI feature analysis.  
   *  **VERIFY tests** to assess the predictive ability of the models, including y-shuffle,
      y-mean, and one-hot encoding tests.  

The code has been designed for:

   *  **Inexperienced researchers** in the field of ML. ROBERT workflows are fully automated, and provide 
      users with comprehensive explanations of the resulting models and their prediction reliability. 
      Moreover, ready-to-use examples and tutorials can be accessed on ReadtheDocs and YouTube. 
   *  **ML experts** aiming to automate workflows, enhance reproducibility, or save time. Entire workflows 
      can be executed using a single command line while following modern standards of reproducibility and 
      transparency. Additionally, individual ROBERT modules can be integrated into customized ML workflows.

.. installation-start

Installation
++++++++++++

In a nutshell, ROBERT and its dependencies are installed as follows:

**1.** Create and activate the conda environment where you want to install the program. If you are not sure of what 
this point means, check out the "Users with no Python experience" section. This is an example for Python 3.10, but 
it also works for newer Python versions (i.e., 3.11 and 3.12):

.. code-block:: shell 
   
   conda create -n robert python=3.10
   conda activate robert

**2.** Install ROBERT and the intelex accelerator with pip (only if your system is compatible with intelex):  

.. code-block:: shell 
   
   pip install robert
   pip install scikit-learn-intelex==2025.2.0

**3.** Install GLib, GTK3, pango and mscorefonts to avoid errors when creating the PDF report:  

.. code-block:: shell 
   
   conda install -y -c conda-forge glib gtk3 pango mscorefonts

.. warning::

   In some computers, you might see lots of pop-up windows with errors when installing GLib. Just press "Accept" in all the windows and finish the process until you see "Done" in the terminal.

**(Alternative installation).** You can use conda-forge in step 2 instead of pip, executing these commands:  

.. code-block:: shell

   conda install -c conda-forge robert
   pip install robert --upgrade
   pip install scikit-learn-intelex==2025.2.0
   conda install -y -c conda-forge glib gtk3 pango mscorefonts

.. warning::

   On some Linux systems (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04), you may also need to install gtk2 in addition to gtk3 to avoid errors related to missing libraries (such as 'libgobject-2.0-0'). You can install it with:

   .. code-block:: shell

      conda install -c conda-forge gtk2

.. installation-end 

.. note-start 

Users with no Python experience
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You need a terminal with Python to install and run ROBERT. These are some suggested first steps:  

.. |br| raw:: html

   <br />

**1.** Install `Anaconda with Python 3 <https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install>`__ for your 
operating system (Windows, macOS or Linux). Alternatively, if you're familiar with conda installers, 
you can install `Miniconda with Python 3 <https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html>`__ 
(requires less space than Anaconda).  


**2.** Open an Anaconda prompt (Windows users) or a terminal (macOS and Linux).


**3.** Create a conda environment called "robert" with Python (:code:`conda create -n robert python=3.10`). 
|br|
*You only need to do this once.*
|br|
*This is an example for Python 3.10, but it also works for newer Python versions (i.e., 3.11 and 3.12).*


**4.** Activate the conda environment called "robert" (:code:`conda activate robert`).


**5.** Install ROBERT as defined in the "Installation" section (:code:`pip install robert`).


**6.** Install the intelex code accelerator (only if your system is compatible with intelex) (:code:`pip install scikit-learn-intelex==2025.2.0`).


**7.** Install GLib, GTK3, pango and mscorefonts to avoid errors when creating the PDF report (:code:`conda install -y -c conda-forge glib gtk3 pango mscorefonts`).


**8.** Go to the folder with your CSV database (using the "cd" command, i.e. :code:`cd C:/Users/test_robert`).


**9.** Run ROBERT as explained in the Examples section.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): easyROB
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You need a terminal with Python to run easyROB, the GUI of ROBERT. This GUI simplifies the setup 
of ROBERT workflows, enabling users to select files and configure options easily. To run easyROB follow
these steps: 

**1.** Install ROBERT as defined in the "Installation" section.


**2.** Install RDKit (:code: `pip install rdkit`)

.. warning::

   The GUI only works with ROBERT version 1.0.5 or later (check your version!). 

**3.** Open an Anaconda prompt (Windows users) or a terminal (macOS and Linux).


**4.** Activate the conda environment called "robert" (:code:`conda activate robert`).
